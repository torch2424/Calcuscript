##Submitting Pull Requests and Issues
**Please Please Please** Submit any bugs or any fixes you would like fixed about the app. 
Since I do professional development, and personal web development projects,
I dont have as much time as I used to for my android apps,
So any help finding and squashing bugs is appreciated :)

##Building and testing
Clone the repo, and open in in a text editor! :) To add to chrome simply go to Settings > Extensions > Load unpacked Extension


##License

P.S I don't know much about each licenses haha
